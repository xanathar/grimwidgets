(JKos)		- Added gw_text (just a plain text without any parent element)
			- Added gw_element:getAncestor() which returns the 1st parent of the element in hierarchy or self if parent is not defined
			- Added gw_element:deactivate(),gw_element:activate() methods and gw_element.active property
				so it's now possible to close the parent gui element by calling self:getAncestor():deactivate()
